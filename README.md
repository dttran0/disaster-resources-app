## BeaconAid

BeaconAid uses Flutter’s geolocation features to pinpoint a user’s location. It then pulls real-time data from the National Weather Service to identify nearby natural disasters and overlays them on an interactive map. Simultaneously, it locates essential resource centers like shelters, food banks, and hospitals using Google Maps. Users can tap on disaster zones to see how far they are and what supplies are needed. Likewise, tapping on resource centers provides details on available aid. Aside from serving users that near the disaster warning zone, BeaconAid also encouraged non-dangers individuals to participate and volunteer in multiple options, where point will be rewarded upon every volunteer act. By combining these features, BeaconAid serves as a real-time hub for disaster response and volunteer coordination.

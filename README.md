## BeaconAid

BeaconAid uses Flutter’s geolocation features to pinpoint a user’s location. It then pulls real-time data from the National Weather Service to identify nearby natural disasters and overlays them on an interactive map. Simultaneously, it locates essential resource centers like shelters, food banks, and hospitals using Google Maps. Users can tap on disaster zones to see how far they are and what supplies are needed. Likewise, tapping on resource centers provides details on available aid. Aside from serving users that near the disaster warning zone, BeaconAid also encouraged non-dangers individuals to participate and volunteer in multiple options, where point will be rewarded upon every volunteer act. By combining these features, BeaconAid serves as a real-time hub for disaster response and volunteer coordination.


## How We Built It
We developed BeaconAid in Flutter to ensure accessibility across mobile devices, prioritizing fast load times and a smooth user experience. For real-time disaster tracking, we integrated APIs from the National Weather Service. Google Maps helps locate vital aid centers, and OpenPass assists in determining nearby cities. By blending these technologies, we created a reliable and user-friendly platform that brings critical information directly to those who need it. To saved and maintain the volunteers credentials and points status, we also deployed Firebase database that will store the username and the points that are accumulated.
